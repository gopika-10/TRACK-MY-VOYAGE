# ðŸš¢ TRACK-MY-VOYAGE

**TRACK-MY-VOYAGE** is a website that detects ships in satellite images using the YOLOv8 deep learning model.
Problem Statement
With the rising volume of maritime activity, there are increasing concerns related to border security, illegal fishing, smuggling, and overcrowded vessels. Monitoring these activities is crucial for maritime safety and national security. However, current manual surveillance techniques are often time-consuming, lack scalability, and may fail to provide the necessary insights for effective decision-making. There is a growing need for a system that can analyze satellite images to detect and classify ships, identify people onboard, and determine if vessels have entered sensitive or restricted areas. Such capabilities are essential for enhancing maritime awareness and supporting law enforcement and environmental protection efforts.
